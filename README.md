## 🌍 The Problem

During a disaster, **coordination kills more time than the disaster itself.** Citizens can't reach responders. Duplicate reports overwhelm operators. Volunteers show up at the wrong place. The right skills never meet the right crisis.

**CommunityPulse fixes this.**

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎙️ Multimodal Emergency Ingestion
Citizens report crises the way humans communicate — by talking. The AI handles the rest.

- **Voice-first reporting** via Web Speech API with real-time transcription
- **Natural language understanding** powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash — no forms, no friction
- **6 languages supported**: English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu
- **Photo evidence upload** with instant AI analysis and scene verification
- **Automatic GPS extraction** — location is inferred and validated, not manually entered

### 🧠 Predictive Intelligence Dashboard
The Command Center doesn't just display data — it thinks ahead.

- **Live crisis heatmaps** rendered via canvas-accelerated Leaflet overlays
- **AI Criticality Scoring (0–100)** weighing scale, urgency, and report velocity in real time
- **Semantic deduplication** — cosine similarity on AI embeddings clusters overlapping reports into unified "Crisis Clusters", eliminating noise and redundant dispatch
- **90-second auto-refresh** triggers escalation risk predictions before situations deteriorate

### 🚁 Autonomous Dispatch System
The right volunteer, at the right place, at the right time.

- **Intelligent matching** scores volunteers on skills, availability, and proximity (5km geofence)
- **Haversine distance calculations** ensure accurate real-world routing, not straight-line guesses
- **Reliability scoring** deprioritizes no-shows from past responses automatically
- **WhatsApp-ready dispatch messages** generated in the volunteer's language, ready to send

## 📦 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js **v18+**
- A free [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- *(Optional)* Firebase `serviceAccount.json` for cloud persistence

> **No credentials? No problem.** Skip the API key and the system auto-boots in **Demo Mode** with 1,150+ pre-seeded volunteers and 8 live crisis scenarios.

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Create your environment file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

npm run dev
# → API running at http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → App running at http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Navigate

## 🎨 Accessibility & Visibility

CommunityPulse is built for the field, not just the office.

- **Pure Black** high-contrast theme for direct sunlight readability
- **Pure White** theme for nighttime/low-light operations
- Voice-first design removes literacy and typing barriers for citizens in distress

---

## 🛡️ Demo Mode

No credentials needed to explore the full system. Run without `serviceAccount.json` and the app loads a high-fidelity mock environment:

- ✅ **1,150+ pre-seeded volunteers** with varied skills and locations
- ✅ **8 active crisis scenarios** across different severity levels
- ✅ All AI features active (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- ✅ Full dispatch simulation with match scoring

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] SMS fallback ingestion for low-connectivity zones
- [ ] Offline-capable PWA for field volunteers
- [ ] Multi-agency coordination view (Police, Fire, Medical)
- [ ] Automated post-incident analytics and response time reporting
