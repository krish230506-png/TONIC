## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎙️ Multimodal Emergency Ingestion
- **Interactive AI Call**: Citizens can speak naturally to an AI assistant that understands context and location in multiple languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu).
- **Visual Evidence**: Upload photos of incidents directly from the field for instant AI analysis and verification.
- **GPS-Aware**: Automatic location extraction ensures help is sent exactly where it's needed.

### 🧠 Predictive Intelligence Dashboard
- **Dynamic Heatmaps**: Visualizes crisis density in real-time using GPU-accelerated Leaflet overlays.
- **Criticality Scoring**: AI automatically ranks incidents from 0-100 based on scale, urgency, and report velocity.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Semantic analysis groups multiple reports of the same incident into a single "Crisis Cluster" to prevent resource waste.

### 🚁 Autonomous Dispatch System
- **Intelligent Matching**: The system analyzes volunteer skills, distance (5km geofence), and reliability to find the perfect responder.
- **WhatsApp-Ready**: Generates personalized, localized dispatch messages ready for instant transmission.

## 🌐 Technical Architecture

| Pillar | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | Web Speech API for real-time transcription + Gemini for semantic extraction. |
| **Analysis** | Cosine similarity on AI embeddings for sub-2km deduplication. |
| **Dispatch** | Haversine distance calculations paired with Skill-Match scoring. |
| **Intelligence** | 90-second automated refresh of predictive crisis escalation risks. |

## 🛡️ Demo Notes
- **Local Mode**: If no `serviceAccount.json` is provided, the system defaults to a high-fidelity local mock mode with 1,150+ pre-seeded volunteers and 8 initial crisis scenarios.
- **Pure Mode**: Supports Pure Black/Pure White high-contrast themes for outdoor/nighttime visibility.
